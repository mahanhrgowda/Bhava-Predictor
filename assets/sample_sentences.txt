I feel at peace with myself and the world.
Let us stand strong in the face of adversity.
My heart weeps for those who suffer.
I bow in devotion to the divine presence.
Knowledge is the light that guides us all.
I’m full of energy and excited to begin.
Anger rises against injustice and lies.
With respect and dignity, we listen to all.
This view is absolutely breathtaking!
That joke was hilarious—I can't stop laughing.
Love blooms in every corner of my heart.
